udacity_Liz is the best performing by far. runs on the edges of the lane line but otherwise doesn't do anything bad

(but actually the ones not using any of my data, just the 4x augmented training data provided is the best lol)

udacity_dom_liz as problems with some curves + runs out of the course at the itnersection with the dirt road

udacity_liz_avoid too.... i added some swerving data for a relatively straight portion of the track but it causes the problem at the dirt road :/

none of them work well on the second track, can't get past the first hill
